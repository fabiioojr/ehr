        Contains the names of the attributes, separated by commas, that
        will be used to sort the result of the query. For ascending sort,
        use the '+' character before the attribute name. For descending
        sort, use the '-' character before the attribute name. By default,
        the order is ascending, so the '+' symbol is optional, just enter
        the attribute.

      description: >-
        To filter a collection by multiple concurrent attributes or filter
        multiple values for an attribute, simply use the attribute/property
        name with an equal sign and the expected values, separated by a comma.
        **_property=value1,value2,value3_**. The query is not case sensitive.
        Example: **_?name=elvis,john_** to retrieve exactly the same users with
        elvis or john name.
        For filtering with logical operators, just follow the syntax:
        **_property=operator:value_**. The available operators are:
         - **gt** -> Defines which value of the attribute is greater than
                    (that is,>) the specified value.
         - **gte** -> Defines which attribute value is greater than or equal to
                    (that is,>=) the specified value.
         - **lt** -> Define the value of the attribute to be less than (that is, <)
                    the specified value.
         - **lte** -> Defines which value of the attribute is less than or equal to
                    (that is, <=) the specified value.

        Example: **_?field1=gte:80&age=lt:100_** to recover the users with age
        is greater than or equal to 80 and less then 100.
